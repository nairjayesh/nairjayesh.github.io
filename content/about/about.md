I'm a full-time student pursuing Masters in AI & Autonomous Systems at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt. Previously I used to work as a Solution's Engineer at [Minto.ai](https://www.minto.ai) and had earned a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Pune, India.  

<!-- My full CV can be found [here].  -->

<!-- Apart from that, I like Generative Art, playing with SOTA tools, to make music, videos, data visualizations and more. Some of my work can be found [here].  -->

I have a deep interest in making computer's "see" things, along with the "tools" that make them see such as traditional camera's, event based camera's, light-field systems etc. I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to work on the same. 

You can contact me via the social's [here](/), or via email: [lastname][firstname]098[at]gmail.
