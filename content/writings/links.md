Jun 21 '25. Re-read the written work on [the value of nothing](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/), observations match with what I'm currently drafting as an essay. A strage excitement in writing the same. 

The source was from one of [George Hotz's video](https://youtu.be/upZf-BWF1i0?t=2047), the longer rant on economics, american empire, china, bitcoin etc. is quite good. 

Recently got hooked to watching the [life of two canadian's in a Japanese country side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKd98OZF94s&t=275s), if not for supposed peace I experience seeing the videos, it was definitely worth it for the aesthetic value of each frame shot. Kudos to that! 

Started reading [Maitreyan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIyUADTDy1M) book Manushyarariyan - മനുഷ്യരറിയാൻ. Quite a few interesting ideas and avenues to explore.
