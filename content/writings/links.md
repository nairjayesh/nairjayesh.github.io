Jun 21 '25. In personal news, I'm moving to Munich, to work as a student and to work on my Master's Thesis with [Nexustec.eu](https://www.nexustec.de/), more on that later. 

As part of moving, I was curious how cycle friendly is the city, the distance from where I live to the office is about 10 kms via cycling. Almost 40 mins of travel time one way. Found some links on Cycling around in Munich city - which is overhauling it's cycling infrastructure! [Munich - touring through the city - 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7aA3PvLX6Q) and [Munich - touring through the city - 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjP2Lt5OtfI) show a good deal of what is the city currently like for cycling and what are their plans in the future.


Re-read the written work on [the value of nothing](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/), observations match with what I'm currently drafting as an essay. A strage excitement in writing the same. 

The source was from one of [George Hotz's video](https://youtu.be/upZf-BWF1i0?t=2047), the longer rant on economics, american empire, china, bitcoin etc. is quite good. 

Jun 20 '25 Started reading [Maitreyan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIyUADTDy1M) book Manushyarariyan - മനുഷ്യരറിയാൻ. Quite a few interesting ideas and avenues to explore. 

Recently got hooked to watching the [life of two canadian's in a Japanese country side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKd98OZF94s&t=275s), if not for supposed peace I experience seeing the videos, it was definitely worth it for the aesthetic value of each frame shot. Kudos to that!
