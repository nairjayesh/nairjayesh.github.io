**Jul 1 '25.** Turned 27, moved to Munich - ready to be poor ;). Mostly, open questions about wealth, money and paper currency is on my mind. Watched another video on the paper money, still lot's to understand, but this one is more on the role of Central Government banks (in context of UK's Bank, but obviously applicable to India & The US) - [97% Owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcGh1Dex4Yo&t=3365s). Man, if you can't trust "numbers in the bank", bond's and stocks (I hope you've read [Value of Nothing](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/)), then what is left. You can't buy commodities and just store them somewhere safe (Or can you ?). 

The next best thing is to roll up your sleeves, and create wealth. This thing is important for literal survival of everyone. I used to think that wealth would mean "assets being held", or "large sums of money" or vaguely "that big company / startup / business". But all that wealth is - OR as David would say - [wealth as a set of physical transformations that we can affect](https://nav.al/david-deutsch). 

A knowledge of and ability to control your means of production of food, water, and electricity is wealth. An economy essentially is exchange of goods and services such as above (that go way beyond the basics). It's also, an attempt at improving life by solving problems, winning over nature - that's what market's respected. 

The finance sector was born and it destroyed [the very map](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2025/02/24/money-is-the-map.html) used to keep track of this exchange. It was a way to keep in check, problems, that would cause ny excessive spending on defence, on waging wars, on jacking up asset prices to sell to the sucker that held it till the end, and it's now paper floating around. 

Well, Wealth,  Urban Mobility design, building inter-generational stability and wealth was on my mind. As an aside theme. Also see - [WTF Happened in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/). 

Also found another short story by the Ted Kaczynski to be quite interesting - [Ship of Fools](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-ship-of-fools).

Ultimately, grateful for the opportunities so far and cautious of the opportunities to win over nature. And get insanely good at things. 

**Jun 22 '25.** Should be studying for an upcoming exam, but went into a rabbit hole on how Fragile money really is. Some interesting links, like this cartoon on [How Money Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4XL8s1BEdk) was the first trigger. If you are looking for serious adult explanations look at the series [Hidden Secrets of Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU&t=746s). 


**Jun 21 '25.** In personal news, I'm moving to Munich, to work as a student and to work on my Master's Thesis with [Nexustec.eu](https://www.nexustec.de/), more on that later. 

As part of moving, I was curious how cycle friendly is the city, the distance from where I live to the office is about 10 kms via cycling. Almost 40 mins of travel time one way. Found some links on Cycling around in Munich city - which is overhauling it's cycling infrastructure! [Munich - touring through the city - 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7aA3PvLX6Q) and [Munich - touring through the city - 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjP2Lt5OtfI) show a good deal of what is the city currently like for cycling and wfhat are their plans in the future.


Re-read the written work on [the value of nothing](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/), observations match with what I'm currently drafting as an essay. A strage excitement in writing the same. 

The source was from one of [George Hotz's video](https://youtu.be/upZf-BWF1i0?t=2047), the longer rant on economics, american empire, china, bitcoin etc. is quite good. 

**Jun 20 '25.** Started reading [Maitreyan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIyUADTDy1M) book Manushyarariyan - മനുഷ്യരറിയാൻ. Quite a few interesting ideas and avenues to explore. 

Recently got hooked to watching the [life of two canadian's in a Japanese country side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKd98OZF94s&t=275s), if not for supposed peace I experience seeing the videos, it was definitely worth it for the aesthetic value of each frame shot. Kudos to that!
