**Jan 29 '26.** I found an old video dated from 2022 yesterday. It was the first time I recorded a "project" I did by writing programs and running them on my computer. Although I have been working with computers since I was a child, and did write some very basic programs in languages such as HTML, LOGO, Java and MATLAB from time to time, I never really got into programming. My first job was far from the aspect of day to day programming. Yet, I made this video during that time. Looking back, it feels like, I always stuck with this, even when it was not something I was paid to do, nor was good at. It was simply something I was interested in. 

Video can be found <a href="/refs/My_first_interesting_animation 1.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>, if you'res curious. I used the Processing framework to make some circles move around screen.  

**Jan 28 '26.**  

**Jan 23 '26.**  I felt like posting a short rant today. There's an an analogy in the book [The Untethered Soul](https://untetheredsoul.com/), which talks about how you end up identifying yourself as the mind - akin to how you identify yourself as part of watching a movie. I feel, esp. with most media for consumption (be it movies, anime, pornography & news) only "hook" you in - the moment you start identifying yourself as part of the narrative being presented. It is designed for immersion. Given the right circumstances, the right kind of person and narrative, we can get sucked in. 

**Jan 1 '26.** Happy New Year!  My last log was posted in October.  I didn't feel the intellectual growth compared to the year 2024.  That being said, there are a few things that I was happy about.  

Firstly, this website itself. I've had a website, or some place to host writings in the past, but this was the first time I felt like calling something "a home on the internet" *(yes, it sounds cheeky)*. I combined a few elements from [websites I've visited](https://nairjayesh.github.io/writings/websites/). The **"refs"** section is where I host various pdf's (inspired from [worrydream](https://worrydream.com/refs/) and [gwern](gwern.net)). **Readings** - which hosts books/articles that I've read. I'm planning to improve the design for to make it more like a virtual shelf (see [here](https://dynamicland.org/2024/Roots/)).  The last addition was **Logs**. It was built from a need to have a single place to store stray links, thoughts and content, the inspiration came from [Ran Prier's site](https://ranprieur.com/). Apart from these, other sections seem standard. 
I'm excited about improving the design of current website as well as the experience for myself as someone who posts stuff on it and people (if any) who read this stuff. There's lot's of work to get done!  

Secondly, I got to travel a lot in start of 2025, covering parts of Western and Eastern Europe - Poland (Warsaw, Auschwitz) , Czech Republic (Prague) and Austria (Salzburg, Vienna). Additionally, I went on fewer hikes (one solo) in the nearby alpine regions in Bavaria as well as bike rides by the Donau river.  I ended the year by travelling back home (Maharashtra and Kerala), visiting friends and lazying around. 

While, this year I don't plan to travel, these places would be on my radar for travelling in case I can save up time and money: Netherlands (Amsterdam, Groningen), France (Strasbourg, Paris) and hopefully getting to go on more hikes and bike rides. 

Things I thought a lot about: 1) Consumption - especially digital media. Such as social media feeds or just movies and television series. Here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP5uH7TWiUs).  I genuinely believe, without learning new things and solving real problems, we would grow dumber, just by virtue of not continuously learning to use our intelligence. As, each new skill you learn requires you to not only understand the skill in question, but also about yourself. What works for you in X scenario, when do you feel frustrated, what helps and what doesn't help (example, I found lecture videos and tutorials to be my thing). 2) Regression - things in life are not guaranteed to improve. Even if you've done things the "right-way", went to school, got a degree, got a job and other shenanigans. You must be constantly vigilant, because regression is the default. Just like entropy and poverty in the world is default, nations and individuals don't just keep growing wealth. I experienced regression in the second half of 2025.     

I also got into watching Anime and reading manga (comics). These seemed to bring stories to life via a form of storytelling I've not experienced before (special emphasis on character growth and internal monologues). Although not a regret, I do wish I would have spent less time on these, because it's really good, and it pulls you in towards "binge-watching". Some things I liked: [Your Lie in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April), [Re:Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Zero), [Mushoko Tensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushoku_Tensei), [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan), [Blue Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Box_(manga)), [Chainsaw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man), [Cross Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Game), [Berserk (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(1997_TV_series)), [Kids on a Slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_on_the_Slope) (read the manga, gives a complete ending, compared to the one in the anime), [A Silent Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Silent_Voice_(film)), [Whisper of the Heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_of_the_Heart), [From Up the Poppy Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Up_on_Poppy_Hill), [I want to eat your pancreas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Eat_Your_Pancreas_(film)) and [DanDaDan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandadan).
