      <description>Update:&#xA;What to work on? What to learn and how to think about this question of spending majority of your time into something? I have been trying to figure out answers to questions as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s not straight-forward.&#xA;I feel our culture / written works around these questions, have a lot of different opinions, and mostly leave out the messy part - the empty dread of not knowing what comes next when you decide upon something.</description>
