      <description>Jan 1 &amp;lsquo;26. Happy New Year! My last log was posted in October. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the intellectual growth compared to the year 2024. That being said, there are a few things that I was happy about.&#xA;Firstly, this website itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a website, or some place to host writings in the past, but this was the first time I felt like calling something &amp;ldquo;a home on the internet&amp;rdquo; (yes, it sounds cheeky).</description>

      <description>Oct 25 &amp;lsquo;25. Been reading the series Exiting Modernity by Meta-Nomad.&#xA;Oct 14 &amp;lsquo;25. Read a decent write up on Alec Radford. For anyone who know&amp;rsquo;s the field, the man is a prolific researcher. His work spans Audio (Generative Audio), Speech (Whisper) , Text (GPT1, GPT2) to Vision (CLIP).&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m still not up to do much work today. So, I have instead been watching a series of videos on the Secret History by the Predictive History YouTube channel.</description>

      <description>Thank you to the authors for publishing on the Internet!&#xA;from ESR&amp;rsquo;s Jargon File:&#xA;hacker: n. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users&amp;rsquo; Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.</description>

      <title>What to work on?</title>

      <description>Update:&#xA;What to work on? What to learn and how to think about this question of spending majority of your time into something? I have been trying to figure out answers to questions as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s not straight-forward.&#xA;I feel our culture / written works around these questions, have a lot of different opinions, and mostly leave out the messy part - the empty dread of not knowing what comes next when you decide upon something.</description>
