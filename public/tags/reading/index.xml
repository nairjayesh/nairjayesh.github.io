      <description>Jan 1 &amp;lsquo;26. Happy New Year! My last log was posted in October. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the intellectual growth compared to the year 2024. That being said, there are a few things that I was happy about.&#xA;Firstly, this website itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a website, or some place to host writings in the past, but this was the first time I felt like calling something &amp;ldquo;a home on the internet&amp;rdquo; (yes, it sounds cheeky).</description>

      <description>Oct 25 &amp;lsquo;25. Been reading the series Exiting Modernity by Meta-Nomad.&#xA;Oct 14 &amp;lsquo;25. Read a decent write up on Alec Radford. For anyone who know&amp;rsquo;s the field, the man is a prolific researcher. His work spans Audio (Generative Audio), Speech (Whisper) , Text (GPT1, GPT2) to Vision (CLIP).&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m still not up to do much work today. So, I have instead been watching a series of videos on the Secret History by the Predictive History YouTube channel.</description>
