      <description>This was initially a project done as part of Principles of Autonomy and Decision Making at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt. The goal was to implement and test Q-Learning and Deep-Q-Learning in a custom environment.&#xA;Currently, this page serves as a gateway to exploring different RL algorithms on various environments, starting with Value function based methods.&#xA;1/ Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning 1.1/ The Environment: The custom environment was built on top of frameworks such as Gymnasium and PyGames.</description>
