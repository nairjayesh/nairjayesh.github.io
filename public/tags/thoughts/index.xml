      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What does silence sound like?” That is not the question I began my day with. I woke up with a cool breeze hitting my body, it is a summer morning - at the backdrop of a warm atmosphere, the fan was running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I checked the time - it was 6:45 AM. it was a pleasant surprise, I slept at 12:00 AM and half expecting myself to wake up early, I had an alarm for 7:15 AM. It is a different feeling all together for me - when it feels like I’m ahead of the day, as opposed to playing catch up throughout the day - why is it so, maybe for some other time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On August 15, 1995, Indians woke up to the tariff plan of a new sort of communication service. They could buy dial-up internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Rs 15,000 a year, it was not quite something the average Indian could afford then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was still a young kid when I had a glimpse of the Internet&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The old dial-up connection tones, the slow speeds and hefty charges levied.  But I was part of the generation that grew up with it’s evolving use cases. From simple search back then to entire generations who experience banking online and now even - &lt;a href=&#34;https://minto.ai/digital-transformation-series-what-are-we-learning-from-our-ongoing-deployments/&#34;&gt;digital factories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
