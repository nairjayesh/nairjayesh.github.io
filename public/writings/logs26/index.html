    <p><strong>Jan 1 &lsquo;26.</strong> Happy New Year!  My last log was posted in October.  I didn&rsquo;t feel the intellectual growth compared to the year 2024.  That being said, there are a few things that I was happy about.</p>
<p>Firstly, this website itself. I&rsquo;ve had a website, or some place to host writings in the past, but this was the first time I felt like calling something &ldquo;a home on the internet&rdquo; <em>(yes, it sounds cheeky)</em>. I combined a few elements from <a href="https://nairjayesh.github.io/writings/websites/">websites I&rsquo;ve visited</a>. The <strong>&ldquo;refs&rdquo;</strong> section is where I host various pdf&rsquo;s (inspired from <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/">worrydream</a> and <a href="gwern.net">gwern</a>). <strong>Readings</strong> - which hosts books/articles that I&rsquo;ve read. I&rsquo;m planning to improve the design for to make it more like a virtual shelf (see <a href="https://dynamicland.org/2024/Roots/">here</a>).  The last addition was <strong>Logs</strong>. It was built from a need to have a single place to store stray links, thoughts and content, the inspiration came from <a href="https://ranprieur.com/">Ran Prier&rsquo;s site</a>. Apart from these, other sections seem standard.
I&rsquo;m excited about improving the design of current website as well as the experience for myself as someone who posts stuff on it and people (if any) who read this stuff. There&rsquo;s lot&rsquo;s of work to get done!</p>
<p>Secondly, I got to travel a lot in start of 2025, covering parts of Western and Eastern Europe - Poland (Warsaw, Auschwitz) , Czech Republic (Prague) and Austria (Salzburg, Vienna). Additionally, I went on fewer hikes (one solo) in the nearby alpine regions in Bavaria as well as bike rides by the Donau river.  I ended the year by travelling back home (Maharashtra and Kerala), visiting friends and lazying around.</p>
<p>While, this year I don&rsquo;t plan to travel, these places would be on my radar for travelling in case I can save up time and money: Netherlands (Amsterdam, Groningen), France (Strasbourg, Paris) and hopefully getting to go on more hikes and bike rides.</p>
<p>Things I thought a lot about: 1) Consumption - especially digital media. Such as social media feeds or just movies and television series. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP5uH7TWiUs">link</a>.  I genuinely believe, without learning new things and solving real problems, we would grow dumber, just by virtue of not continuously learning to use our intelligence. As, each new skill you learn requires you to not only understand the skill in question, but also about yourself. What works for you in X scenario, when do you feel frustrated, what helps and what doesn&rsquo;t help (example, I found lecture videos and tutorials to be my thing). 2) Regression - things in life are not guaranteed to improve. Even if you&rsquo;ve done things the &ldquo;right-way&rdquo;, went to school, got a degree, got a job and other shenanigans. You must be constantly vigilant, because regression is the default. Just like entropy and poverty in the world is default, nations and individuals don&rsquo;t just keep growing wealth. I experienced regression in the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>I also got into watching Anime and reading manga (comics). These seemed to bring stories to life via a form of storytelling I&rsquo;ve not experienced before (special emphasis on character growth and internal monologues). Although not a regret, I do wish I would have spent less time on these, because it&rsquo;s really good, and it pulls you in towards &ldquo;binge-watching&rdquo;.
